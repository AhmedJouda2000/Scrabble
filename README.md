# Scrabble
### Software Engineering Project 2, UCD BSc. Computer Science 2nd Year
Implemented the board game Scrabble (2 player) in Java and JavaFX in a team of *three* over *five* sprints.

## Contents
### Scrabble Bots
This is a simulation. When the program is run, two bots face off in a Scrabble match and you can watch them play on the Scrabble board.

### Scrabble Two Player
This program, when run, allows you to play two player Scrabble.

## Getting Started
- Download either the **Scrabble Bots** or **Scrabble Two Player** depending on what you want to do.
- Unzip the folder and import it into an IDE, my recommendation is [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/)
- Once the project is imported into the IDE run the file called **Scrabble.java**
- The game will commence.
